# 💫 About Me:
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence Science (AIS). Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and core computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.<br><br>I have worked on several academic and practical projects, including designing a 4-bit ALU, developing an Airline Reservation System, creating advanced SQL and database normalization diagrams, and performing air-quality data analysis by combining pollutants, temperature, and humidity data. I am also currently working on an AI-related research paper, which has strengthened my analytical and research skills.<br><br>While AIS is my main specialization, I am also exploring related applied fields such as Data Analysis and Data Science, as I believe they provide strong practical experience and open diverse career paths both locally and internationally.<br><br>I am highly motivated and goal-oriented, with a long-term plan to pursue international opportunities in Europe or the Gulf region. I enjoy organized, structured work, problem-solving, and contributing to real-world solutions using AI and data-driven techniques. I am always eager to learn, improve, and expand my technical capabilities.
